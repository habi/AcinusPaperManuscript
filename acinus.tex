\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
Due a restricted availability of high resolution three-dimensional imaging methods the knowledge about the development of the functional unit of the lung is limited. These functional units of the lung parenchyma are the so called pulmonary acini, which correspond to the gas-exchange volume in the lung which is ventilated by one purely conducting airway~\cite{Rodriguez1987}, see \autoref{fig:acinus schematic}.\todo{Add info about size of acini and some more information} Using synchrotron radiation based tomographic microscopy \cite{Haberthuer2010a} we developed a method to evaluate the volume of single acini throughout postnatal lung development\todo{Why did we want to do that? Do we need to list/explain existing prior models?}. In pre-experiments assessing the lung structure using three-dimensional visualizations of synchrotron radiation based tomographic microscopy datasets we have seen that the functional lung units---the so-called acini---seen to grow to a larger extent than expected from \emph{simple} lung development.

The lung structure can be assessed using stereology~\cite{Hsia2010}, as shown by \citet{Tschanz2002}. Such an analysis is generally based on serial sections of the sample, thus the extracted information is a two-dimensional description \blockquote[\cite{Tschanz2002}]{of the parenchymal air space geometry and, due to geometric laws, it is not allowed to extrapolate these \twod statements directly to \threed structures}. With stereological methods it is fairly easy to extract global volume information\todojcs{From a region, from a ROI?}, but it not easily possible to extract such information from a functional unit of any organ, since it cannot easily be judged which detail on the microscopy slide belong to which functional unit in the three-dimensional compound.

\section{Materials \& Methods}\label{sec:MM}
\subsection{Rat lung samples}
We used rat lung samples, prepared according to \cite{Tschanz2002,Luyet2002}. Briefly, lungs of Sprague-Dawley rats were instilled with \SI{2.5}{\percent} glutaraldehyde (\cf{CH2(CH2CHO)2}) in \SI{0.03}{\Molar} potassium-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at a constant pressure of \SI{20}{\centi\meter} water column via tracheotomy. This pressure was maintained during the fixation (in the same fixative at \SI{4}{\celsius} for at least \SI{24}{\hour}) in order to prevent a recoiling and to preserve a mid-respiratory \todojcs{Is mid-respiratory true, or is this full volume?} state of the lung.

To prepare the samples for tomographic imaging, they were postfixed with \SI{1}{\percent} osmium tetroxide (\cf{OsO4}) and stained with \SI{4}{\percent} uranyl nitrate (\cf{UO2(NO3)2}) to increase the x-ray absorption contrast, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in paraffin using Histoclear (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) as an intermedium. Subsequently, the lung samples were mounted onto standard scanning electron microscopy sample holders (PLANO GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) using paraffin~\cite{Tsuda2008}. After this processing, the samples can be regarded as inert and can be kept as long as desired prior to tomographic scanning.

The handling of animals before and during the experiments, as well as the experiments themselves, were approved and supervised by the Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape and the Veterinary Service of the Canton of Bern, Switzerland.

\subsection{Tomographic data acquisition}\label{sec:tomcat}
All tomographic experiments for this publication were performed at the \href{http://www.psi.ch/sls/tomcat/}{TOMCAT beamline} at the \href{http://www.psi.ch/sls/}{Swiss Light Source}, \href{http://www.psi.ch/}{Paul Scherrer Institut}, Villigen, Switzerland~\cite{Stampanoni2006a}. The samples were scanned at \SI{20.0}{\kilo\electronvolt}. After penetration through the sample, the x-rays were converted into visible light by a \SI{20}{\micro\meter} thick LuAG:Ce scintillator (Lutetium Aluminum Garnet activated by cerium, \cf{Lu3Al5O12}, from \href{http://www.crytur.cz/}{Crytur Ltd.}, Turnov, Czech Republic). A 10\(\times\) magnifying, diffraction limited microscope optics was used to magnify the image on the scintillator screen and a high-resolution 2048\(\times\)2048 pixel CCD camera (pco.2000, PCO AG, Kelheim, Germany) with \SI{14}{\bit} dynamic range was used to digitize this image. For noise-reduction and speed purposes we operated the detector in 2\(\times\)2 binning mode. As a result, the pixel size was \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter} and the exposure time was between \SIrange{160}{180}{\milli\second}.

To be able to distinguish the alveolar septa \todojcs{How thick are they in the rat: approx.~\SI{8}{\micro\meter}?} in the resulting tomographic images, a resolution in the order of one micron is required. Since we selectively wanted to extract a large amount of single acini\footnote{\citet{Weibel1997} estimated that a human lung consists of \num{30000} acini.}\todo{Do we have data on how many and how large acini there are in the rat lung?}, we not only needed to acquire high resolution tomographic scans, but a acquire a dataset with a large volume in high resolution. Usually---with classic microscopy based imaging methods---a large field of view can only be acquired with low magnification and vice-versa. Thus, the full volume of our samples would not have fit inside the classic field of view of the TOMCAT beamline at the aforementioned optical properties (1.52\(\times\)1.52\(\times\)\SI{1.52}{\milli\meter}).

Nevertheless, the scannig parameters described at the beginning of \autoref{sec:tomcat} are correct; we did enhance the field of view of the TOMCAT beamline at the chosen optical configuration. This enhancement was done with the so called wide-field scanning protocol~\cite{Haberthuer2010}. Briefly, several partial scans covering the desired field of view have been independently acquired. After acquisition, the partial projections are merged to one large projection spanning the desired field of view. The merging of the single projections was implemented on the tomographic reconstruction cluster, thus we were able to use the classic tomographic reconstruction workflow at TOMCAT. The details of the beamline setup and reconstruction workflow have been described in details by \citet{Stampanoni2006a} and \citet{Hintermueller2010}.

With this approach we increased the lateral field of view at TOMCAT three-fold, while keeping both voxel size and reconstruction quality on the desired level and avoiding the aforementioned trade-off between voxel size and sample volume. Since we also performed a so called stacked scan in relation to the z-axis of the tomographic setup, we even further increased the field of view and recorded volume of our samples. Finally, we acqured tomographic dataset of approximately 3000\(\times\)3000\(\times\)3072 pixels \todo{Or do we give exact sizes, between 2938 and 2946 px?} with \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter} pixel size. This corresponds to a 9-fold increase in recorded volume as compared to one classic scan at TOMCAT, giving us the advantage of both high resolution images and large visible sample volume.

\subsection{Visualization and Extraction of Acini}
The tomographic datasets of the sample were three-dimensionally analyzed and visualized using \href{http://mevislab.de}{MeVisLab} (Version 2.1 (2010-07-26 Release)~\cite{Bitter2007}, MeVis Medical Solutions AG and Fraunhofer MEVIS - Institute for Medical Image Computing, Bremen, Germany). The calculations have been performed on a Dell Precision T7500 work station (\SI{24}{\giga\byte} RAM, Intel Xeon CPU X5550 at \SI{2.66}{\giga\hertz}, Windows 7 Professional \SI{64}{\bit}).

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}
The tomographic datasets obtaied at TOMCAT were converted from a stack of TIFF-files to the native GVR format of MeVisLab, a multi-resolution \href{https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Octree&oldid=409131920}{octree}-based image format. This permitted us to interactively perform the visualization and analysis on a lower resolution prior to the final analysis.

\subsubsection{Manhole Covers}\label{sec:manhole covers}
On binned datasets we extracted conducting airway segments (see \autoref{fig:acinus schematic}) using a threshold interval based region growing algorithm~\cite{Zucker1976}. A seed point for the region growing algorithm was manually defined inside the terminal bronchiole or alveolar duct on one of the most proximal slices of the dataset (shown in \autoref{subfig:sample}). This approach made it possible to extract a connected airway segment, which was then further divided in conducting and gas-exchanging airways. This division was performed with manually placed circular segmentations stoppers, which we dubbed manhole covers (shown as red discs in \autoref{subfig:airway segment} and \subref*{subfig:extracted acini}). The manhole covers were manually placed in the airway segment based on morphological criteria, \ie on changes in the airway wall structure which mark the entrance point into the acinus.

Using a separate region growing module, we subsequently extracted single acini from the datasets (shown as yellow volumes in \autoref{subfig:extracted acini}) automatically. The manhole covers\footnote{The manhole covers were implemented through a \href{http://www.mevis-research.de/cgi-bin/discus/board-auth.cgi?lm=1282233250&file=/839/11760.html}{custom module (\emph{XMarkerClipPlanes})} by Milo Hindennach, a member of the MeVis Developer team.} placed in the first step are fully defined through their diameter and \href{https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Surface_normal&oldid=411684319}{surface normal}. This made it possible to automatically define the seed point for additional region growing modules used for the extraction of the single acini. We simply flipped the direction of the surface normal and placed the seed point along this vector slightly behind the manhole cover, inside the acinar airspace. The only manual work left was the iterative selection of the correct grayvalue threshold used for the region growing segmentation.

The volume of the single acini was determined using the product of segmented voxels with the voxel volume, tabulated and prepared for analysis. The segmented acini were also exported to single \href{https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Digital_Imaging_and_Communications_in_Medicine&oldid=415023605}{DICOM} files to facilitate eventual further processing in either MeVisLab, \href{http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/}{ImageJ}~\cite{Abramoff2004} or the \href{http://stepanizer.com/}{Stepanizer}~\cite{Tschanz2010}.

\section{Results}\label{sec:Results}

A summary of the data from the extracted acinar volumes is shown in \autoref{tab:summary}. The data has been analyzed using R (Version 2.12.1 (2010-12-16)~\cite{R}.

	\label{plot}
\end{figure}

We observed an approximately thirty-three-fold increase of the mean acinar volume during the postnatal lung development from days \numrange{4}{60} (33.25-fold, from \SIrange{0.00260}{0.08646}{\micro\litre}). During the same period the volume of the right lower lung lobe increases only approximately ten-fold (9.72-fold, from \SIrange{0.305}{2.964}{\centi\metre\cubed}, see \cite{Tschanz2003}), which results in an acinar growth 3.4 times larger than the right lower lung lobe volume.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:Discussion}
We hypothesize that this large increase of the acinar volume can only be achieved by a conversion of the \numrange{2}{4} most distal purely conducting airways into alveolar ducts between birth and adulthood. As a consequence \numrange{4}{16} small acini have to be merged to a larger one. We expect that the increased complexity of the adult acini influences both ventilation and particle deposition.
