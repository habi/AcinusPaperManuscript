# Visualization and stereological characterization of individual rat lung acini by high-resolution X-ray tomographic microscopy

During my PhD at the [Institute of Anatomy](http://ana.unibe.ch) of the [University of Bern](http://unibe.ch) I was running a SVN repository server on the [virtual server infrastructure](http://www.id.unibe.ch/content/services/hosting/virtuelle_server/) of the University of Bern.

Since I'm no longer working there I migrated all the code to GitHub, using `git svn clone http://code.ana.unibe.ch/svn/RepositoryName`

This repository contains everything that was necessary to write the paper about *[Visualization and stereological characterization of individual rat lung acini by high-resolution X-ray tomographic microscopy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00642.2013)* in the [Journal of Applied Physiology](http://jap.physiology.org).
